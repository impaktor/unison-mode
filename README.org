#+TITLE unison-mode

* Introduction
  This mode was written to add syntax highlighting to unison configuration
  files, and also as an exercise for myself to learn to write a major mode for
  Emacs.

* Install
  Put the file =unison-mode.el= in your load-path. If you do not have a load
  path, then add one, that points to the folder where you placed the file:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/elisp/")
#+end_src

  Secondly, to use the mode for all *prf files:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (autoload 'unison-mode "unison-mode" "my unison mode" t)
  (setq auto-mode-alist (append '(("\\.prf$" . unison-mode)) auto-mode-alist))
#+end_src
